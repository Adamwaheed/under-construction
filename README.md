# Under Construction

![](screenshot.png)

A simple HTML document designed to be used as the temporary home page of a website.

Note that the document language is set to `tr-TR` for Turkish, because that is usually what I need. The paragraph text reads: *"Our website is under construction."*

## Usage

1. Edit `index.html` in order to change the title and the header.
2. Upload the file to the root directory of your website.
